Lab: Deploying and using certificates

Scenario

You are working as an administrator at A. Datum Corporation. As A. Datum expands, its security
requirements are also increasing. The Security department particularly is interested in enabling secure
access to critical websites and in providing additional security for features such as EFS, digital signatures,
smart cards, and the DirectAccess feature in Windows 8.1 and Windows 10. The Security department
especially wants to evaluate digital signatures in Microsoft Office documents. To address these and
other security requirements, A. Datum has decided to use certificates issued by the AD CS role in
Windows Server 2022.
As a senior network administrator at A. Datum, you are responsible for implementing certificate enrollment.
You also will be developing the procedures and process for managing certificate templates and for
deploying and revoking certificates.
Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will have:
Configured certificate templates.
Configured certificate enrollment and usage.
Configured and implemented key recovery.
Lab Setup

Virtual machines: 20742B-LON-DC1, 20742B-LON-SVR1, 20742B-LON-SVR2
